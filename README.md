## Installation

⚠️ Limitation : You must have a Spotify Premium account to access the in-game Spotify player. You must have an internet connection to access the radio and Spotify.

They are two type of installation. You can either simply download the mod, follow the brief instructions and access all Spotify music via our servers (recommended). Or you host the server yourself, but I'd advise you to have some server/programming knowledge to be able to deal with any errors (we're not planning any very advanced docs on this subject).

### Easiest Method

BeamRadio is a BeamNG.drive mod. You can download it from BeamNG's in-game repo or from their website in *community > mods > BeamRadio*. You can also download the mod on this GitHub page.

You can follow step-by-step installation :

1. Install BeamRadio's archive here.

2. You must unzip the mod.

3. Place the unzip mod... 

### Avenced Method



## Settings

Before you can use it in the game and enjoy your favorite music and radio stations, you need to set up the mod.
